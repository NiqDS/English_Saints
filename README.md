# English_Saints

The history of churches in England dates back several centuries. Different counties name their places of worship after many different saints, some associated with the area, others influenced by waves of time, rolling throughout the country. The purpose of the project is to assess the popularity of the many saints in names of churches in England, to see who prevails where and perhaps to find historical grounds for the leaders on the board.

The raw data of the names of the churches and historical events in the regions in question is gathered from Wikipedia source and uploaded as a raw .csv file for wrangling, cleaning and analysis.
